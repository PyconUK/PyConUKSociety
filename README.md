# PyConUKSociety

This repository contains the constitution, AGM agendas and minutes for the PyCon UK Society.

The PyCon UK Society is the formal organisation behind the UK Python community.
Members of the Society organise the [PyCon UK](http://pyconuk.org/) conference and associated events, and the Society is legally and financially responsible for those events.

Every year the Society holds an Annual General Meeting, to elect its officers and plan events for the coming year.
The AGM is normally held during the PyCon UK conference, to make it easier for as many people as possible to attend.
Everyone is welcome at the AGM and we are particularly keen to have new people join the Society.
